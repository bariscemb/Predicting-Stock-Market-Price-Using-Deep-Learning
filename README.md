# Predicting-Stock-Market-Price-Using-Deep-Learning



Stock market forecasting is an important field on many economists and 
researchers have been studying. Although previous economical theories such as 
Efficient Market Hypothesis and Random Walk Theory argue that prediction that 
predict stock market prices is not possible, further researches show that stock 
prices can be foreseen accurately by using some techniques and mathematical 
formulas. While two main approaches which are fundamental analysis and 
technical analysis have been used for the prediction of stock market for last 
century, thanks to developments in computer science area, machine learning 
techniques have been used since 1990’s in prediction of stock market prices. 
There are many researches show that Artificial Neuron Networks can predict 
stock prices in high accuracy rates. Most of researches in literature regarding with 
predicting stock market indexes such as NASDAQ, S&P 500 or BIST 30. In 
addition, in most of the existence researches on the field technical indicators are 
not utilized in their prediction models. In this project it was chosen four big 
(Aselsan, Turkish Airline, Arcelik, Eregli Demir Celik) Turkish companies’ stocks 
for price prediction and some technical indicators were added to prediction model 
to get increase accuracy of results. Long Short Term Memory Neural Network 
which is advanced version of Artificial Neuron Network was utilized as prediction 
technique. Price and volume data which between the period of May 22, 2006 and 
May 18, 2021 are utilized as input datasets. Two different models that differ in 
their architecture were developed to predict prices. The results show that 
companies’ stock prices in Turkish stock market can be predicted in high accuracy 
ratios as well as when technical indicators are applied to the base prediction 
model, prediction accuracy was increased.
